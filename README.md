Deploy Jackbot onto your Delta team and he will accompany you into battle! Jackbot remains cloaked and
appears only when you need him to scrap your duplicate characters, emblems & weapon skins.

### Requirements
* `Java 8`
* `Google Chrome` _tested on v57.0 (64 bit)_

#### Jackbot uses Selenium 3 and the Chrome WebDriver to automate the process of scrapping duplicate cards so you don't
#### have to.
